Version 2: April 28 2021 

The PBMMMP is intended to provide athletes and fitness enthusiasts with an exercise alternative which accounts and adjusts for immutable--or less mutable--individual musculoskeletal profiles and physiological properties. In theory, the PBMMMP should be able to help physiques transcend trivial difference plateaus and achieve stronger baselines, and is logically the superior alternative for beginner as well as advanced use.
