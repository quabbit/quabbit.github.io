Neurological Effect and Personality Triage Tool (NEP)

P. A. E. (Paul) Betito BA MSW

Version 2: April 27 2021

The NEP is a tertiary, two-tier screening tool (<=90 seconds) for i) diffuse neural consequences and/or ii) focal neural pathologies, based on expected personality characteristics according to the OCEAN personality acronym/mnemonic. Apart from its primary clinical intent, it has largely the goals of facilitating personality assessment in medical terms, integrating personality dimensions for clinical prominence and relevance, and converting personality assessment to managable short-form usage. It has the additional intent to support the cultivation of doctor-patient alliance. It requires the application of sound clinical judgment.

Categorical coding and associated priorities: 
BRIEF response=LOW priority=0
DISMISSAL response=LOW priority=0 
HOSTILE response=MEDIUM priority=1 
ENGAGED response=MEDIUM priority=1
INABILITY response=HIGH priority=2
CONFUSION response=HIGH priority=2

Outcome: 
Higher-priority triage 

1. If you do not mind, I have a couple very general questions for you. It would help me to learn a bit more about who you are as a person.

If prompted: 1.1. Sometimes how we define ourselves instinctively helps to clarify to a doctor whether there is something else to address, or whether something is worth checking into a bit further. Does that make sense?

2. Just to remind you, these are very general questions; know that there are no right answers, and my expectation is only that you go with your first impression. Does that work with you? 

3. (Conscienciousness): My first question is, Do you practice a lot of cleanliness and/or organization in your life?
	YES - Brief
	YES - Engaged
	NO - Brief
	NO - Engaged
	N/A - Inability or Confusion
	N/A - Dismissal
	HOSTILITY: No problem. We can skip this question (as well).
  
4. (Openness): Thank you. And how do you tend to feel about the world, generally?
	GOOD - Brief
	GOOD - Engaged
	BAD - Brief
	BAD - Engaged
	N/A - Inability or Confusion
	N/A - Dismissal
	HOSTILITY: No problem. We can skip this question.
  
5. (Extraversion): Do you often tend to get involved or to participate with others?
	YES - Brief
	YES - Engaged
	NO - Brief
	NO - Engaged
	N/A - Inability or Confusion
	N/A - Dismissal
	HOSTILITY: No problem. We can skip this question (as well).

6. (Agreeableness): And how do you tend to trust and feel about others, for the most part?
  WELL - Brief
  WELL - Engaged
	POORLY - Brief
	POORLY - Engaged
	N/A - Inability or Confusion
	N/A - Dismissal
	HOSTILITY: No problem. We can skip this question (as well).
  
7. (Neuroticism): How do you feel about yourself, for the most part?
	GOOD - Brief
	GOOD - Engaged
	BAD - Brief
	BAD - Engaged
	N/A - Inability or Confusion
	N/A - Dismissal
	HOSTILITY: No problem. That was my last question. I appreciate your patience.
