Rapid Medical Personal Severity Triage Checklist (RMPS)

P. A. E. (Paul) Betito BA MSW

Version 2: Tuesday April 27 2021

The RMPS is intended for brief assessment of needs for additional resources or support within medical decision-making contexts, but guided specifically by patient vocation. It requires that the clinician provide an informed judgment given the provided patient vocation, and thus it is predicated on reasonable awareness of minimum and prominent sources of medical distress and related and general disproportions of impact and expenditure.

Minimum assumptions:
- Hospital-based practice;
- Adequate community resources;
- Independence from chronic involvement.

Minimum qualitative information: 
- Nature of presentation; 
- Time course;
- Patient vocation;
- Disruption (immediate life circumstances).

Thresholds:
Above cut-off: Triage to desired resource
Below cut-off: Proceed as usual

Coding:
HIGHER=2
MEDIUM=1
LOWER=0

Case example: A young adult male is presenting with injuries from a physical altercation (2). He sustained a 1-inch, non-life-threatening puncture wound in the abdominal region (0), a concussion (1), a broken hand (2), a broken arm (0), and a broken knee (1). The patient plays professional hockey (1).

1. Structural injury:
- Fine motor (hand, eye) (disruptive) (HIGHER)

2. Organ injury:
- Lower body (kidneys AND OR liver AND OR genitourinary) (HIGHER)
- Brain (MEDIUM)
- Middle body (gastrointestinal AND OR cardiovascular) (LOWER)

3. Illness:
- Incapacitating (HIGHER)
- Viral (MEDIUM)
- Bacterial (LOWER)

4. Effect:
- Focal (LOWER)
- Diffuse (HIGHER)

5. Basis of involvement:
- Acute (HIGHER)
- Chronic (LOWER)

6. Visit format:
- Surgical procedure (MEDIUM)
- Impromptu and disruptive (time-sensitive; nighttime; child and infant with guardian or guardians; lower-income bracket) (HIGHER)
- Other (LOWER)

7. Treatment regimen:
- Long-term medication regimen (>=1 month) (HIGHER)
- Impairment-level dosages (MEDIUM)
