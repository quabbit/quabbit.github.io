Version 2: April 28 2021

The RGEMS is intended to provide an accessible, longer-term observational capacity for monitoring efficacy within short- or longer-term clinical interactions. The goals of the RGEMS are to promote more effective practice and accountability, to improve professionalism and promote professional development, and to equip patients or clients with an additional item of information pertaining to clinical progress, such that they make better informed decisions. The RGEMS is intended to be implemented in a tertiary or quaternary manner; every 3-4 sessions
